# HarvardX PH526x - Using Python for Research

**_This repository is only for educational purposes and any use of this repository for academic dishonesty is not permitted._**

## About

The course focuses on using Python and its extensive libraries for research and data analysis. 

This course has touched upon some elementary concepts to the programming language, like data types, functions, as well as advanced concepts, such as scoping, object-oriented programing using classes. 

Libraries such as ```numpy```, ```matplotlib```, ```pandas``` and many more, have been extensively explored and their potential uses in the field of research and data handling/analysis are seen.

## Contents
- This repository contains self-made notes from the video lectures as well as some examples that are added by my discretion.

- Since it was a course I have done and completed, I have also posted the Homework Assignments that we required to do in order to earn the certification of this course. This goes without saying that there can be mistakes in the actual answers, or there may codes more efficient to the ones I have written. Please keep in mind if referencing this repository as a resource.
